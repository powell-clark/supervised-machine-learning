# Machine Learning Lesson Series Update Plan
November 28, 2024 (21:30 - 00:00)

## Context & Series Structure

We're developing a progressive machine learning education series:

1. Logistic Regression (Lesson 1)
   - Foundation for binary classification
   - Introduction to model evaluation
   - Sets up key concepts for tree-based models

2. Decision Trees Series:
   - Theory (2a) - Mathematical foundations
   - Fundamentals (2b) - Practical implementation
   - Model Comparison (2c) - ATLAS pipeline showcase

3. Neural Networks (Lesson 3)
   - Building on prior lessons
   - Advanced classification concepts

### Project Focus (16:40 - 00:00)
Primary focus is implementing smooth transition from decision trees theory 2a, to fundamentals 2b to ATLAS in 2c while ensuring smooth progression from lesson 1 logistic regression through to lesson 3 neural networks.

## Current State Assessment

### Progress Made
- ATLAS pipeline integrated into 2c
- Basic code structure working
- Logistic regression lesson complete
- Strong foundation for progression

### Priority Order

2. **2b - Decision Tree Fundamentals** (Highest Priority)
   - Bridge between theory and comparison
   - Explains decision trees, random forests and XGbost
   - Sets up ATLAS performing simple implemntations of decision trees, random forests and XGBOOST
   - introduces atlas our way of comparing the models

1. **2c - Model Comparison with ATLAS** 
   - Mostly complete
   - Showcases for ATLAS pipeline
   - Links fundamentals to advanced concepts

3. **2a - Decision Tree Theory**
   - Foundation for entire tree series
   - Must align with ATLAS methodology and setup read with knowledge required for 2b
