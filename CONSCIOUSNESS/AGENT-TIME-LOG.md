This sequential processing creates two problems: it's slow (can't parallelize), and it struggles with long-range dependencies (information from 100 tokens ago gets diluted).  Transformers solve both problems by processing all tokens simultaneously and using attention to directly connect any two positions in the sequence, regardless of distance.  **What you'll learn:** - How attention lets models focus on relevant parts of the input - The math behind self-attention and multi-head attention - The complete Transformer architecture (encoder-decoder) - Why positional encodings matter for sequence modeling - Differences between BERT (bidirectional) and GPT (autoregressive) - Practical NLP with Hugging Face Transformers - Vision Transformers and beyond language  **Prerequisites:** - Neural networks (Lesson 3a, 3b) - RNNs helpful but not required (Lesson 9b) - Basic linear algebra (matrix multiplication, dot products)  **Why this matters:** Transformers power ChatGPT, Claude, BERT, and most modern NLP systems. Since 2017, they've expanded beyond language into computer vision (Vision Transformers), protein folding (AlphaFold), and multimodal tasks. If you want to work with modern AI systems, you need to understand how they work.  ---"""  nb['cells'][0]['source'] = [line + '\n' for line in new_intro.split('\n')]  with open('notebooks/9c_transformers_attention.ipynb', 'w') as f:     json.dump(nb, f, indent=1)  print("✅ Fixed 9c cell 0") EOF
