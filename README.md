# ðŸŽ“ Supervised Machine Learning

This repository teaches machine learning from first principles using Python. Starting with foundational mathematics (derivatives, exp/log, probability), each notebook builds complete understanding before exploring modern tools like scikit-learn and PyTorch. All mathematical concepts are derived step-by-step, making the content accessible to anyone with basic calculus knowledge. Part of a broader machine learning series, with companion repositories for unsupervised, reinforcement and other types of learning in development.
