# Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository demonstrates modern approaches to supervised learning, focusing on practical implementation and production-ready code. It's part of a broader machine learning education series, with companion repositories for unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning (coming soon).

## Key Features
- Production-grade implementation of ML algorithms
- Modern PyTorch-based development
- Comprehensive evaluation frameworks
- Real-world datasets
- Industry-standard practices

## Lessons
Each lesson combines theory with practical implementation:

### 1. Logistic Regression
- [Binary Classification Tutorial](notebooks/1_logistic_regression.ipynb)
  - PyTorch implementation
  - Model evaluation
  - Medical diagnosis case study

### 2. Decision Trees & Ensemble Methods
- [Theory and Foundations](notebooks/2a_decision_trees_theory.ipynb)
- [Practical Implementation](notebooks/2b_decision_trees_practical.ipynb)
  - Feature engineering
  - Model comparison pipeline
  - Random Forests and XGBoost

### 3. Neural Networks
- [Deep Learning Basics](notebooks/3_neural_networks.ipynb) (In Progress)
  - PyTorch implementation
