# üéì Supervised Machine Learning

This repository teaches machine learning from first principles using Python. 

Starting with foundational mathematics (derivatives, exp/log, probability), each notebook builds complete understanding before exploring modern tools like Scikit-learn and PyTorch. 

All mathematical concepts are derived step-by-step, making the content accessible to anyone with basic high school calculus knowledge. This aims to be part of a broader machine learning series, with companion repositories for unsupervised, reinforcement and other state-of-the-art machine learning domains in development.
