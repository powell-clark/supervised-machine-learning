# Lesson 3: Random Forests and the Path to Neural Networks

## Introduction

Building on our exploration of Decision Trees, this lesson delves deeper into Random Forests. We'll start with our familiar London housing dataset and then expand to showcase the versatility of Random Forests, ultimately paving the way for our next topic: Neural Networks.

This structure allows you to:

1. Reinforce the concepts learned with the London housing data.
2. Expand into classification problems, showcasing the versatility of Random Forests.
3. Introduce key concepts that are relevant to both Random Forests and Neural Networks (e.g., feature importance, hyperparameter tuning).
4. Highlight the strengths of Random Forests while also pointing out areas where Neural Networks might offer advantages.
5. Create conceptual bridges between Random Forests and Neural Networks, preparing learners for the transition to the next topic.

In each section, you can:
- Start with Random Forest concepts and applications
- Draw parallels to similar concepts in Neural Networks
- Highlight situations where Neural Networks might offer different or improved approaches

This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of Random Forests while also setting the stage for the upcoming Neural Networks lesson. It creates a smooth learning progression and helps students understand the relationship between these different machine learning techniques.
