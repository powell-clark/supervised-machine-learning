    "**COMPAS Recidivism Algorithm (2016)**\n",
    "- Used to predict criminal reoffending\n",

    "- Impact: Biased decisions affected real people's freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "**Amazon Hiring Algorithm (2018)**\n",
    "- Trained on historical hiring data (mostly men)\n",
    "- Learned to penalize resumes containing words like \"women's\"\n",

    "- Amazon scrapped the system\n",
    "\n",
    "**Facial Recognition Systems**\n",
    "- Higher error rates for people of color, especially women\n",
    "- Led to wrongful arrests\n",
    "- Many cities banned police use of facial recognition\n",

    "- Tagged Black people as \"gorillas\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**EU AI Act**\n",
    "- High-risk AI systems must undergo bias testing\n",

    "\n",
    "**Historical Bias**\n",
    "- Data reflects historical discrimination\n",
    "- Example: Hiring data shows mostly men in leadership → model learns to prefer men\n",
    "- **Not fixable by better algorithms alone** - requires societal awareness\n",

    "**Representation Bias**\n",
    "- Training data doesn't represent all groups equally\n",
    "- Example: Facial recognition trained mostly on white faces → fails on other races\n",
    "- **Fix**: Collect diverse, representative data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measurement Bias**\n",
    "- Features measured differently for different groups\n",
    "- Example: Credit scores systematically lower for certain neighborhoods\n",
    "- **Fix**: Audit measurement processes, use alternative features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aggregation Bias**\n",
    "- One model for all groups when groups behave differently\n",
    "- Example: Medical diagnostic model trained on adults applied to children\n",
    "- **Fix**: Consider group-specific models or features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Bias**\n",
    "- Test data doesn't represent deployment population\n",
    "- Example: Testing fraud detection only on one demographic\n",
    "- **Fix**: Stratified evaluation across all groups\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Harm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Allocation Harm**\n",
    "- System allocates resources or opportunities unfairly\n",
    "- Examples: Loan denials, job rejections, healthcare access\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quality-of-Service Harm**\n",
    "- System works better for some groups than others\n",
    "- Examples: Speech recognition, facial recognition, translation\n",

    "**Stereotyping Harm**\n",
    "- System reinforces negative stereotypes\n",
    "- Examples: Gender-biased word associations, racist image tagging\n",

    "**Denigration Harm**\n",
    "- System actively insults or demeans groups\n",
    "- Examples: Offensive auto-completions, hate speech generation\n",

    "\n",
    "### Production ML Fairness Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before Training**:\n",
    "- [ ] Audit data for representation bias (are all groups represented?)\n",
    "- [ ] Examine label distribution across protected groups\n",
    "- [ ] Check for proxy variables (features that correlate with protected attributes)\n",
    "- [ ] Document data collection process and potential bias sources\n",
    "- [ ] Define which fairness metric(s) matter for your use case\n",
    "\n",
    "**During Training**:\n",
    "- [ ] Track metrics separately for each protected group\n",
    "- [ ] Consider fairness constraints if needed\n",
    "- [ ] Document model architecture and hyperparameters\n",
    "- [ ] Save training data statistics and distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "**After Training**:\n",
    "- [ ] Measure all relevant fairness metrics\n",
    "- [ ] Create fairness report card\n",
    "- [ ] Test on held-out data from all groups\n",
    "- [ ] Perform error analysis by subgroup\n",
    "- [ ] Consider post-processing if fairness violations detected\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deployment**:\n",
    "- [ ] Monitor fairness metrics in production\n",
    "- [ ] Set up alerts for fairness metric degradation\n",
    "- [ ] Regular fairness audits (quarterly minimum)\n",
    "- [ ] Document model limitations and known biases\n",
    "- [ ] Provide mechanism for users to appeal decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frameworks and Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fairlearn** (Microsoft)\n",
    "- Fairness metrics and mitigation algorithms\n",
    "- Dashboard for comparing models\n",
    "- Python library, well-documented\n",
    "\n",
    "**AIF360** (IBM)\n",
    "- 70+ fairness metrics\n",
    "- 10+ bias mitigation algorithms\n",
    "- More comprehensive than Fairlearn\n",
    "\n",
    "**What-If Tool** (Google)\n",
    "- Visual interface for exploring model behavior\n",
    "- Slice analysis by subgroups\n",
    "- Counterfactual analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aequitas** (University of Chicago)\n",
    "- Bias and fairness audit toolkit\n",
    "- Focus on criminal justice\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing the Right Fairness Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "| Use Case | Primary Fairness Metric | Reasoning |\n",
    "|----------|------------------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Loan Approval** | Equalized Odds | Both false positives and false negatives cause harm |\n",
    "| **Disease Screening** | Equal Opportunity | Missing a disease (false negative) is worst error |\n",
    "| **University Admissions** | Demographic Parity | Want representation from all groups |\n",
    "| **Hiring (initial screen)** | Demographic Parity | Equal access to opportunity |\n",
    "| **Criminal Risk Assessment** | Equalized Odds + Calibration | High stakes, both errors matter |\n",
    "| **Content Moderation** | False Positive Rate Parity | Wrongly censoring speech is harmful |\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Fairness Interventions Don't Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes technical solutions aren't enough:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem is upstream**: If data collection is fundamentally flawed, no algorithm fixes it\n",
    "2. **Prediction task itself is harmful**: Maybe you shouldn't build this model at all\n",
    "3. **Societal bias too strong**: Historical discrimination may be impossible to fully correct\n",
    "4. **Wrong problem framing**: You're optimizing the wrong objective\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Recidivism prediction\n",
    "- Even \"fair\" models may perpetuate mass incarceration\n",
    "- The question isn't \"how do we make fair predictions?\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**Ethics is not optional in 2025.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Between legal requirements (EU AI Act, anti-discrimination laws), reputational risks, and moral imperatives, you MUST build fair AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques in this notebook - fairness metrics, bias detection, mitigation algorithms - are your tools. But tools alone aren't enough. You need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Critical thinking**: Question whether the system should exist\n",
    "- **Stakeholder engagement**: Listen to affected communities  \n",
    "- **Humility**: Acknowledge what you don't know\n",
    "- **Courage**: Speak up when you see harmful systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**You are responsible for the systems you build.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your skills wisely. Build AI that helps people, not harms them. And when in doubt, ask: \"Would I want this algorithm making decisions about my life?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If the answer is no, don't build it."
