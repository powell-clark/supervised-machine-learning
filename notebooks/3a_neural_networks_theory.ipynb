    "\n",
    "Neural networks can be understood by thinking about how you learned to recognize handwritten digits as a child.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first saw the number '7', you didn't memorize every possible way to write it. Instead, your brain learned patterns: a horizontal line at the top, a diagonal stroke going down-right, sometimes with a small horizontal dash through the middle. After seeing dozens of examples - some neat, some messy, some stylized - your brain built an internal representation that could recognize '7' even when written by someone you'd never met.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's exactly what neural networks do. They learn hierarchical patterns from data. The first layer might detect simple edges and curves. The next layer combines these into more complex shapes like circles or corners. Deeper layers recognize complete digits by combining these shapes. After training on thousands of examples, the network can recognize handwritten digits it has never seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the theory behind neural networks and how they differ from logistic regression\n",
    "2. Build a multi-layer neural network from scratch to deeply understand each component\n",
    "3. Implement forward propagation and backpropagation by hand\n",
    "4. Apply it to the MNIST handwritten digit dataset\n",
    "5. Visualize what the network learns and how it makes decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in the next lesson (3b), we'll:\n",
    "1. Use PyTorch to implement the same network more efficiently\n",
    "2. Examine modern architectures and optimization techniques\n",
    "3. Learn best practices for training deep neural networks in production\n"

    "- **Layer 3** combines shapes into parts of digits\n",
    "- **Output Layer** combines parts into complete digit recognition\n",
