    "# Lesson 2: Decision Trees for House Price Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a versatile machine learning model for both classification and regression tasks. In this lesson, we'll use decision trees to predict house prices based on features like location, size, and amenities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a real estate agent trying to estimate the fair price of a house based on its characteristics. This is where decision trees can help. They learn a set of rules from historical data to make predictions on new, unseen houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, a decision tree is used to make predictions on the target variable - say price - by recursively splitting the data based on the values of the features, choosing splits that maximize the similarity of the target variable (prices) within each subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a tree-like model of decisions and their consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you'll understand how decision trees work, how to train and interpret them, and how they compare to other models for regression tasks.\n",

    "## Intuition Behind Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're trying to predict the price of a house based on its features. You might start by asking broad questions like \"Is it in a desirable location?\" and then progressively get more specific: \"How many bedrooms does it have? What's the square footage?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, you're trying to split the houses into groups that are as similar as possible in terms of price. This is exactly how a decision tree works - it asks a series of questions about the features, each time trying to split the data into more homogeneous subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Choose Decision Trees for House Prices?\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are particularly well-suited for this task because of several key advantages that become apparent when comparing them to other popular algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Natural Handling of Mixed Data Types**\n",
    "   While algorithms like Linear Regression and Neural Networks require categorical variables to be encoded numerically, and K-Nearest Neighbors struggles with mixed data types, decision trees naturally handle our varied real estate data:\n",
    "   - Numerical: Price (£180,000 to £39,750,000), square footage (274 to 15,405 sq ft)\n",
    "   - Categorical: Location (\"Chelsea\", \"Hackney\"), house type (\"Flat\", \"House\", \"Penthouse\")\n",
    "   - Ordinal: Number of bedrooms (1-10), bathrooms (1-10), receptions (1-10)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Feature Scaling Required**\n",
    "   Unlike many other algorithms, decision trees work with raw values directly. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Compare this to:\n",
    "   - Linear/Logistic Regression: Requires scaling to prevent features with larger values from dominating the model\n",
    "   - Neural Networks: Needs normalized inputs (usually between 0-1) for stable gradient descent\n",
    "   - Support Vector Machines (SVM): Highly sensitive to feature scales, requires standardization\n",
    "   - K-Nearest Neighbors: Distance calculations are skewed by different scales, needs normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "   The tree makes splits based on relative ordering, not absolute values. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   For example, these splits are all equivalent to a decision tree:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Original scale (Decision Tree works fine)\n",
    "   if square_footage > 2000:\n",
    "       predict_price = 1200000\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       predict_price = 800000\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Scaled by 1000 (needed for Neural Networks)\n",
    "   if square_footage/1000 > 2:  # Same result for decision tree\n",
    "       predict_price = 1200000\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       predict_price = 800000\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Standardized (needed for SVM)\n",
    "   if (square_footage - mean)/std > 1.2:  # Same result for decision tree\n",
    "       predict_price = 1200000\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       predict_price = 800000\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretable Decision Making**\n",
    "   While algorithms like Neural Networks act as \"black boxes\" and Linear Regression gives abstract coefficients, decision trees create clear, actionable rules:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if location == \"Chelsea\":\n",
    "       if square_footage > 2000:\n",
    "           predict_price = \"£2.5M\"\n",
    "       else:\n",
    "           predict_price = \"£1.2M\"\n",
    "   elif location == \"Hackney\":\n",
    "       if bedrooms > 3:\n",
    "           predict_price = \"£950K\"\n",
    "       else:\n",
    "           predict_price = \"£650K\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   These rules are easy to explain to stakeholders, unlike trying to interpret neural network weights or SVM kernel transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling Missing Data**\n",
    "   Real estate data often has missing values.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   While Linear Regression, Neural Networks, and SVM typically require imputation or removal of missing values, decision trees can handle this through:\n",
    "   - Using a technique called surrogate splits based on correlated features\n",
    "   - Making predictions even when some feature values are unknown\n",
    "   - Maintaining accuracy with incomplete information\n",
    "\n",
    "These advantages mean we can focus on understanding the relationships in our data rather than spending time on data transformation and scaling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other algorithms would require significant preprocessing:\n",
    "- Linear Regression: Feature scaling + encoding categoricals + handling missing values\n",
    "- Neural Networks: Normalization + one-hot encoding + imputation\n",
    "- SVM: Standardization + kernel selection + handling categoricals\n",
    "- KNN: Feature scaling + careful handling of mixed data types\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes decision trees an excellent choice for our house price prediction task, especially when interpretability and ease of use are priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anatomy of a Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is composed of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nodes: Where a feature is tested\n",
    "- Edges: The outcomes of the test\n",
    "- Leaves: Terminal nodes that contain the final predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "A simplified example of a house prices prediction decision tree might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![structure of a house prices prediction decision tree](../static/house-prices-decision-tree-and-structure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree is built by splitting the data recursively, choosing at each step the feature and split point that results in the greatest reduction in impurity or error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Splitting Criteria Explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a decision tree, we need a way to determine the best feature and value to split on at each node. The goal is to create child nodes that are more \"pure\" or homogeneous than their parent node. The method for measuring this purity and choosing the best split differs between regression and classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Regression Tasks (e.g., Predicting House Prices):\n",
    "\n",
    "In regression problems, we're trying to predict a continuous value, like house prices. The goal is to split the data in a way that minimizes the variance of the target variable within each resulting group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common metric used for regression trees is the Mean Squared Error (MSE). This is the default criterion used by scikit-learn's DecisionTreeRegressor. Let's break down how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a real estate agent with a magical ability to instantly sort houses. Your goal? To group similar houses together as efficiently as possible. This is essentially what a decision tree does, but instead of magical powers, it uses mathematics. Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're playing a house price guessing game. Your goal is to guess the prices of houses as accurately as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have 5 houses, and their actual prices are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "House 1: £200,000\n",
    "House 2: £250,000\n",
    "House 3: £180,000\n",
    "House 4: £220,000\n",
    "House 5: £300,000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Calculate the average price\n",
    "`(200,000 + 250,000 + 180,000 + 220,000 + 300,000) / 5 = £230,000`\n",
    "\n",
    "So, your guess for any house would be £230,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Calculate how wrong you are for each house\n",
    "```\n",
    "House 1: 230,000 - 200,000 = 30,000 \n",
    "House 2: 230,000 - 250,000 = -20,000\n",
    "House 3: 230,000 - 180,000 = 50,000\n",
    "House 4: 230,000 - 220,000 = 10,000\n",
    "House 5: 230,000 - 300,000 = -70,000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Square these differences\n",
    "```\n",
    "House 1: 30,000² = 900,000,000\n",
    "House 2: (-20,000)² = 400,000,000\n",
    "House 3: 50,000² = 2,500,000,000\n",
    "House 4: 10,000² = 100,000,000\n",
    "House 5: (-70,000)² = 4,900,000,000\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Step 4: Add up all these squared differences\n",
    "`\n",
    "900,000,000 + 400,000,000 + 2,500,000,000 + 100,000,000 + 4,900,000,000 = 8,800,000,000\n",
    "`\n",
    "#### Step 5: Divide by the number of houses\n",
    "\n",
    "`8,800,000,000 ÷ 5 = 1,760,000,000`\n",
    "\n",
    "This final number, 1,760,000,000, is your Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical notation, this whole process looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y})^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break this down:\n",
    "- $n$ is the number of houses (5 in our example)\n",
    "- $y_i$ is the actual price of each house\n",
    "- $\\hat{y}$ is your guess (the average price, £230,000 in our example)\n",
    "- $\\sum_{i=1}^n$ means \"add up the following calculation for each house from the first to the last\"\n",
    "- The $i$ in $y_i$ is just a counter, going from 1 to $n$ (1 to 5 in our example)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a python function, this would look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def calculate_mse(actual_prices, predicted_price):\n",
    "    n = len(actual_prices)\n",
    "    squared_errors = []\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for actual_price in actual_prices:\n",
    "        error = predicted_price - actual_price\n",
    "        squared_error = error ** 2\n",
    "        squared_errors.append(squared_error)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    mse = sum(squared_errors) / n\n",
    "    return mse\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "actual_prices = [200000, 250000, 180000, 220000, 300000]\n",
    "predicted_price = sum(actual_prices) / len(actual_prices)  # Average price\n",
    "\n",
    "mse = calculate_mse(actual_prices, predicted_price)\n",
    "print(f\"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.2f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating Decision Points: Understanding Split Quality in Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we split our houses into two groups, we want to measure if this split has made our predictions better. We do this by comparing the error before and after splitting using this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta MSE = MSE_{before} - (({\\text{fraction of houses in left group} \\times MSE_{left}} + {\\text{fraction of houses in right group} \\times MSE_{right}}))$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work through a real example to understand this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we have 5 houses with these prices:\n",
    "```\n",
    "House 1: £200,000\n",
    "House 2: £250,000\n",
    "House 3: £180,000\n",
    "House 4: £220,000\n",
    "House 5: £300,000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We're considering splitting these houses based on whether they have more than 2 bedrooms:\n",
    "- Left group (≤2 bedrooms): Houses 1, 3 (£200,000, £180,000)\n",
    "- Right group (>2 bedrooms): Houses 2, 4, 5 (£250,000, £220,000, £300,000)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. First, let's calculate $MSE_{before}$\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mean price = (200k + 250k + 180k + 220k + 300k) ÷ 5 = £230,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Squared differences from mean:\n",
    "House 1: (230k - 200k)² = 900,000,000\n",
    "House 2: (230k - 250k)² = 400,000,000\n",
    "House 3: (230k - 180k)² = 2,500,000,000\n",
    "House 4: (230k - 220k)² = 100,000,000\n",
    "House 5: (230k - 300k)² = 4,900,000,000\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE_before = (900M + 400M + 2,500M + 100M + 4,900M) ÷ 5\n",
    "           = 1,760,000,000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Now for the left group (≤2 bedrooms):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mean price = (200k + 180k) ÷ 2 = £190,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Squared differences:\n",
    "House 1: (190k - 200k)² = 100,000,000\n",
    "House 3: (190k - 180k)² = 100,000,000\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE_left = (100M + 100M) ÷ 2 = 100,000,000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. And the right group (>2 bedrooms):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mean price = (250k + 220k + 300k) ÷ 3 = £256,667\n",
    "\n",
    "Squared differences:\n",
    "House 2: (256.67k - 250k)² = 44,448,889\n",
    "House 4: (256.67k - 220k)² = 1,344,448,889\n",
    "House 5: (256.67k - 300k)² = 1,877,778,889\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE_right = (44.45M + 1,344.45M + 1,877.78M) ÷ 3 = 1,088,892,222\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Finally, let's put it all together:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ΔMSE = MSE_before - ((2/5 × MSE_left) + (3/5 × MSE_right))\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part calculates our weighted mean MSE after splitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Left group has 2/5 of the houses, so we multiply its MSE by 2/5\n",
    "- Right group has 3/5 of the houses, so we multiply its MSE by 3/5\n",
    "\n",
    "This weighting ensures each house contributes equally to our final calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's solve it:\n",
    "     = 1,760,000,000 - ((2/5 × 100,000,000) + (3/5 × 1,088,892,222))\n",
    "     = 1,760,000,000 - (40,000,000 + 653,335,333)\n",
    "     = 1,760,000,000 - 693,335,333        # This is our weighted mean MSE after splitting\n",
    "     = 1,066,664,667                      # ΔMSE: The reduction in prediction error\n",
    "\n",
    "The ΔMSE (1,066,664,667) represents the difference between the original MSE and the weighted average MSE after splitting. This number is always non-negative due to a fundamental property of squared errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. MSE is always positive (we're squaring differences from the mean)\n",
    "2. When we split a group:\n",
    "   - The parent uses one mean for all samples\n",
    "   - Each subgroup uses its own mean, which minimises squared errors for that subgroup\n",
    "   - The subgroup means must perform at least as well as the parent mean (due to minimising squared errors locally)\n",
    "   - Therefore, the weighted average MSE of subgroups cannot exceed the parent MSE\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "- ΔMSE > 0 means the split has improved predictions (as in our case)\n",
    "- ΔMSE = 0 means the split makes no difference\n",
    "- ΔMSE < 0 is mathematically impossible\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The larger the ΔMSE, the more effective the split is at creating subgroups with similar house prices. Our large ΔMSE of 1,066,664,667 indicates this is a very effective split.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Mean Squared Error (MSE) vs Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating our decision tree's performance, we need to understand the difference between training metrics and evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "![mean-squared-error-mean-absolute-error](../static/mean-squared-error-mean-absolute-error.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our decision tree algorithm uses MSE as the splitting criterion but measures final performance using MAE. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why we use these different metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Calculation:** (predicted house price - actual house price)²\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, if we predict £200,000 for a house that's actually worth £150,000, the error is £50,000 and MSE is £50,000² = £2.5 billion\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Visualisation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   If we plot how wrong our house price prediction is (like £50,000 too high or -£50,000 too low) on the x-axis, and plot the squared value of this error (like £2.5 billion) on the y-axis, we get a U-shaped curve. Because MSE squares the errors, it gives more weight to data points that are further from the mean, making it a good measure of variance within groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The decision tree uses MSE to decide where to split data because minimizing MSE is equivalent to minimizing the variance within each group, which helps find splits that create distinct groups of house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ##### 2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Calculation:** |predicted house price - actual house price|\n",
    "\n",
    "   Using the same example, if we predict £200,000 for a £150,000 house, MAE is |£50,000| = £50,000\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Visualisation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   If we plot how wrong our prediction is on the x-axis (like £50,000 too high or -£50,000 too low), and plot the absolute value of this error on the y-axis (always positive, like £50,000), we get a V-shaped curve\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Purpose**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   We use MAE to evaluate our final model because it's easier to understand - it directly tells us how many pounds we're off by on average\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\n",
    "The decision tree uses MSE's mathematical properties to make splitting decisions, but we report MAE because \"off by £50,000 on average\" makes more sense than \"off by £2.5 billion squared pounds\"!\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error \n",
    "y_true = [100, 200, 300]\n",
    "y_pred = [90, 210, 320]\n",
    "\n",
    "mse = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)\n",
    "mae = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.2f}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Mean Absolute Error: {mae:.2f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mean Squared Error: 200.00\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error: 13.33\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, MSE and MAE provide different views of the error. MSE is more sensitive to the larger error (20) in the third prediction, while MAE treats all errors equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "For house price prediction, MAE is often preferred as it directly translates to the average error in pounds. However, MSE is still commonly used as a splitting criterion in decision trees because minimizing MSE helps create groups with similar target values by minimizing the variance within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Classification Tasks (e.g., Predicting if a House Will Sell Quickly):\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification problems, we're trying to predict a categorical outcome, like whether a house will sell quickly or not. The goal is to split the data in a way that maximizes the \"purity\" of the classes within each resulting group.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several metrics used for classification trees, with the most common being Gini Impurity and Entropy. These metrics measure how mixed the classes are within a group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how different distributions of marbles affect our measures of impurity. We will then explore information gain, a measure used in conjuction with impurity metrics to decide how to split the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use red marbles to represent quick-selling houses and blue marbles for slow-selling houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Gini Impurity:\n",
    "   Gini Impurity measures the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen element if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Formula: $Gini = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{c} (p_i)^2$\n",

    "\n",
    "```code\n",
    "   a) 10 marbles: 7 red, 3 blue\n",

    "\n",
    "**The lower the Gini Impurity, the purer the set. Scenario (c) has the lowest Gini Impurity, indicating it's the most homogeneous.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Entropy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy is another measure of impurity, based on the concept of information theory. It quantifies the amount of uncertainty or randomness in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Entropy = -\\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i \\log_2(p_i)$\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you're playing a guessing game with marbles in a bag. Entropy measures how surprised you'd be when pulling out a marble. The more mixed the colours, the more surprised you might be, and the higher the entropy.\n",

    "#### Let's use our marble scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "10 marbles: 7 red, 3 blue\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the fraction of each colour:\n",
    "```\n",
    "   Red: 7/10 = 0.7\n",
    "   Blue: 3/10 = 0.3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each colour, multiply its fraction by the log2 of its fraction:   \n",
    "```\n",
    "   Red: 0.7 × log2(0.7) = 0.7 × -0.5146 = -0.360\n",
    "   Blue: 0.3 × log2(0.3) = 0.3 × -1.7370 = -0.5211\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sum these values and negate the result:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Entropy = -(-0.3602 + -0.5211) = 0.8813\n",
    "```\n",

    "   Blue: 0.5 × log2(0.5) = 0.5 × -1 = -0.5\n",
    "   Entropy = -(-0.5 + -0.5) = 1\n",

    "\n",
    "Lowest entropy, most predictable set\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower entropy means less surprise or uncertainty. Scenario (c) has the lowest entropy, confirming it's the most predictable (or least mixed) set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we could calculate entropy like this:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Information Gain:\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Gain measures how much a split improves our ability to predict the outcome. It's a way of measuring how much better you've sorted your marbles after dividing them into groups.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Comparison: Splits with Different Information Gains\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm always chooses the split that provides the most Information Gain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider two potential splits of our 20 marbles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split by house size (small vs large):\n",
    "   - Small houses: 8 red, 2 blue\n",
    "   - Large houses: 4 red, 6 blue\n",
    "   - Information Gain: 0.1245\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Split by garage presence:\n",
    "   - Houses with garage: 6 red, 4 blue\n",
    "   - Houses without garage: 6 red, 4 blue\n",
    "   - Information Gain: 0\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm would choose the split by house size because it provides more Information Gain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Zero Information Gain occurs when a split doesn't change the distribution of the target variable (in this case, marble colours or house selling speed). This happens when the proportions in each resulting group are identical to the proportions in the parent group.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, splits with exactly zero Information Gain are rare. More commonly, you'll see splits with varying degrees of positive Information Gain, and the algorithm will choose the one with the highest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features that provide little or no Information Gain are typically less valuable for prediction and should be considered for removal from the model. Eliminating these low-impact features can simplify the model, potentially improving its generalization ability and computational efficiency without significantly compromising predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've explored the key concepts behind decision trees, let's summarize the main points and how they apply to our house price prediction task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regression Trees vs Classification Trees**: \n",
    "   For our house price prediction problem, we're using regression trees. Unlike classification trees which use metrics like Gini impurity or entropy, regression trees aim to minimize the variance in the target variable (house prices) within each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Splitting Criterion**: \n",
    "   In regression trees, the splitting criterion is typically the reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE) or equivalently, the reduction in variance. At each node, the algorithm chooses the feature and split point that maximizes this reduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $\\Delta MSE = MSE_{parent} - (w_{left} * MSE_{left} + w_{right} * MSE_{right})$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Where $w_{left}$ and $w_{right}$ are the proportions of samples in the left and right child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Splitting**: \n",
    "   The tree is built by recursively applying this splitting process, creating a hierarchy of decision rules. This continues until a stopping condition is met, such as a maximum tree depth or a minimum number of samples per leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prediction**: \n",
    "   To predict the price of a new house, we follow the decision rules from the root to a leaf node. The prediction is typically the mean price of all houses in that leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interpretability**: \n",
    "   One of the key advantages of decision trees is their interpretability. We can visualize the tree and follow its decision path, which provides insights into which features are most important for predicting house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Bias-Variance Trade-off**: \n",
    "   Deeper trees can capture more complex relationships in the data but risk overfitting (high variance). Shallower trees are more generalizable but might oversimplify the problem (high bias). Finding the right balance is crucial for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Feature Importance**: \n",
    "   Decision trees naturally perform feature selection. Features that appear higher in the tree or are used in more splits are generally more important for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Handling Non-linearity**: \n",
    "   Unlike linear regression, decision trees can capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, which is often the case in real estate markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Limitations**: \n",
    "   Decision trees can be unstable (small changes in data can result in very different trees) and may struggle with smooth, linear relationships. These limitations are often addressed by ensemble methods like Random Forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move forward to apply these concepts to our London housing dataset, keep in mind that while the theory provides the foundation, the real insights often come from experimenting with the data, tuning the model, and interpreting the results in the context of the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next sections, we'll see how these theoretical concepts translate into practical implementation using Python and scikit-learn, and how we can use decision trees to gain insights into the London housing market.\n",

    "## Exploratory Data Analysis Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our exploratory data analysis reveals several key insights about the London housing market dataset that will influence our approach to building decision tree models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Price Distribution and Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "The price distribution shows significant right-skew, with properties ranging from £180,000 to £39.75M. This 222x range presents both challenges and opportunities:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages for Decision Trees\n",
    "- Trees naturally handle non-normal distributions without transformation\n",
    "- Binary splits can effectively separate luxury properties from standard homes \n",
    "- No assumption of linearity required\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Considerations\n",
    "- Very expensive properties (>£20M) might need special treatment\n",
    "- When evaluating our model we should consider performance across different price ranges\n",
    "- We will want to use price bands for stratified sampling when splitting our data into training and test sets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strong Predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Area (sq ft)\n",
    "- Strongest correlation with price (0.67)\n",
    "- Also shows right-skew distribution\n",
    "- Natural primary splitting candidate for decision trees\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Room Counts\n",
    "- Perfect correlation (1.0) between bedrooms, bathrooms, and receptions\n",
    "- Suggests potential data quality issue\n",
    "- Should select only one room count feature to avoid redundancy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Location Features\n",
    "- 460 unique locations with 27.64% missing values\n",
    "- High cardinality - lots of unique values, shared between few samples - presents a challenge for one-hot encoding method of handling missing data\n",
    "- Other features such as Postal code can provide hierarchical geographic information yet also have a high number of unique values\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing Data\n",
    "The 27.64% missing location data requires careful handling:\n",
    "- Complete case analysis - dropping rows with missing values - would lose too much information\n",
    "- One-hot encoding with missing indicator preserves data patterns\n",
    "- Decision trees can handle missing values effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identical Room Distributions\n",
    "All room count features showing identical distributions (mean: 3.10, range: 0-10) suggests:\n",
    "- Possible data entry issues\n",
    "- Need for data validation\n",
    "- We should select only one room count feature to avoid redundancy and co-linearity issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations for Model Development\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Feature Selection Strategy\n",
    "- Use Area as primary numerical predictor\n",
    "- Use house type as categorical predictor\n",
    "- Select one room count feature\n",
    "- Parse outcode instead of full postocode to reduce the cardinality of this feature\n",
    "- Explore other location features\n",
    "- Consider adding other engineered features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Data Preprocessing Approach\n",
    "- Retain original price scale (no need for transformation)\n",
    "- Handle missing locations with indicator method - onehot encoding with missing category\n",
    "- Consider creating price bands for stratified sampling - when splitting the test train split this will ensure higher priced ranges are well represented in both datasets\n",
    "- Consider binning area into meaningful ranges as a new feature\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model Building Considerations\n",
    "- Set min_samples_leaf to handle price outliers - higher samples per leaf is more robust to outliers, but may miss some of the more subtle patterns in the data\n",
    "- Use cross-validation with stratification\n",
    "- Consider separate models for different price ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Evaluation Strategy\n",
    "- Evaluate performance across price bands\n",
    "- Use both absolute and percentage errors\n",
    "- Compare against simpler baseline models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis suggests our lesson should focus on:\n",
    "- Handling missing categorical data effectively\n",
    "- Managing high cardinality features\n",
    "- Dealing with extreme price outliers\n",
    "- Creating meaningful geographic features\n",
    "- Evaluating model performance across price ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights will help us build more robust and interpretable decision tree models for London house price prediction."

    "Before training our models, we need to prepare our data appropriately. In this lesson we will create multiple datasets to compare different approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create and compare multiple clean Datasets that handle missing data in different ways**\n",
    "   - Dataset A: Leave missing values as is and let the decision tree model handle it\n",
    "   - Dataset B: Drop rows with missing values\n",
    "   - Dataset B: Fill missing values with 'Unknown'\n",
    "   - Dataset C: Use one-hot encoding with missing category\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering and Selection**\n",
    "   - Drop columns we deem non-predictive (e.g., Property Name)\n",
    "   - Create feature sets of increasing complexity:\n",
    "     - Basic: Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Receptions\n",
    "     - Property: Basic + area in sq ft + House Type\n",
    "     - Property + Location Combinations\n",
    "     - Full: All available features including new engineered features such as postcode outcode\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Preprocessing**\n",
    "   - Convert categorical variables to numerical using `LabelEncoder`\n",
    "   - Split each dataset variant into training and test sets\n",
    "   - Apply feature scaling where appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach will allow us to:\n",
    "- Compare the impact of different missing data handling methods\n",
    "- Using the best missing data approach then evaluate the models performance with different feature combinations\n",
    "- We will then compare the performance of the decision tree model with a linear regression and a more advanced technique such as a random forest model.\n",

    "## Handling Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data has a significant amount of missing values, particularly in the 'Location' field where 27% of the values are NaN. \n",
    "\n",
    "While missing data can be problematic for many machine learning models, modern decision tree implementations handle missing values elegantly through advanced techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some libraries use \"surrogate splits\" where alternative features that best approximate the original split are used when the primary split feature has missing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Others, like scikit-learn, use a technique called \"fractional samples\" or \"fractional instances\" where samples with missing values are assigned fractional weights to each branch based on the proportion of non-missing samples that go to each branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach to handling missing data can differ based on whether the variable is categorical or continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Missing Categorical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For categorical variables like 'Location', we can consider the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Leaving the missing values as is and let our decision tree model handle it**\n",
    "2. **Dropping rows with missing values**\n",
    "3. **Filling NaNs with a specific value (e.g., 'Unknown')**\n",
    "3. **One-hot encoding with a separate 'Missing' category**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore these methods and their potential impact on our decision tree model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Leaving the missing values as is and letting our decision tree model handle it\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn's DecisionTreeRegressor has built-in support for handling missing values without the need for explicit imputation or removal of rows. It uses a technique called \"fractional samples\" or \"fractional instances\" to effectively work with missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Fractional Samples Technique:\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering a split for a feature with missing values, the decision tree assigns fractional weights to samples with missing values based on the proportion of non-missing samples that go to each branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if 70% of the non-missing samples go to the left branch and 30% go to the right branch, a sample with a missing value would be assigned a weight of 0.7 for the left branch and 0.3 for the right branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm then proceeds to evaluate the split based on the weighted samples, considering both the non-missing samples and the fractional weights assigned to the missing samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "During prediction, if a new sample has a missing value for a feature used in a split, the sample follows both branches of the split, and the final prediction is a weighted average of the predictions from the leaves reached in each branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- No data loss: All available information is preserved, including rows with missing values.\n",
    "- Avoids introducing bias: The decision tree algorithm can learn from the patterns in the non-missing values without making assumptions about the missing data.\n",
    "- Handles missing values during prediction: The trained model can make predictions on new data that has missing location values.\n",
    "- Efficient and convenient: Eliminates the need for separate data preprocessing steps to handle missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increased complexity: The decision tree algorithm needs to handle missing values internally, which can add complexity to the model training process.\n",
    "- Potential overfitting: If the missing values have a specific pattern or meaning, the decision tree might overfit to that pattern, leading to reduced generalization performance.\n",
    "- Interpretability: The fractional samples approach may make the decision tree splits and structure less intuitive and harder to interpret compared to a clean dataset without missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Dropping Rows with Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest approach is to drop any row that has a missing value. "

    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Problematic assumptions about missing data: When we replace NaN with 'Unknown', we're making an assumption that all missing values represent a specific category that is known to us and related to the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This assumption may not be true because:\n",
    "  - Values might be missing for various unrelated reasons (data entry errors, not collected, etc.)\n",
    "  - Missing values might not have any meaningful relationship to each other\n",
    "  - The missingness itself might not be informative\n",
    "\n",
    "- Potential bias introduction: \n",
    "  - If 'Unknown' has a specific meaning in your domain (e.g., deliberately withheld information), using it as a catch-all for missing values could confuse the model and lead to incorrect predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. One-Hot Encoding with a Separate 'Missing' Category\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, we create a separate category for missing values during one-hot encoding. For example, with our 'Location' column:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Feature Importance\n",
    "- Basic property features alone (bedrooms, area) perform poorly (R² = 0.1749)\n",
    "- Adding area improves performance significantly (R² increases to 0.2919)\n",
    "- Location features provide the biggest boost to performance\n",
    "- The combination of granular location data (Postcode + Outcode) with property features performs best\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Model Evolution\n",
    "- Basic → +Area: +11.7% R² improvement\n",
    "- +House Type: +7.66% additional improvement\n",
    "- +Location features: +23.94% additional improvement\n",
    "- Fine-grained location (Postcode + Outcode): +19.36% final improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Optimal Feature Set\n",
    "The best performing combination includes:\n",
    "- Property characteristics (bedrooms, area, house type)\n",
    "- Outcode (broader postal area)\n",
    "- Full postal code\n",
    "- Specific location details\n",
    "- This combination achieves significantly better results than using either postcode or outcode alone\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Metrics Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n",
    "- Best: £566,853 (Property + Outcode + Postcode + Location)\n",
    "- Worst: £1,068,158 (Basic subset)\n",
    "- Adding location features reduces MAE by approximately 47%\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)\n",
    "- Best: £1,283,867 (Property + Outcode + Postcode + Location)\n",
    "- Worst: £2,388,161 (Basic subset)\n",
    "- Indicates presence of some large prediction errors even in best model, most likely due to the skew and large outliers in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### R² Score\n",
    "- Best: 0.7615 (Property + Outcode + Postcode + Location)\n",
    "- Worst: 0.1749 (Basic subset)\n",
    "- Shows model explains 76.15% of price variance at best\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications & Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Selection Strategy**\n",
    "   - Retain all granular location data\n",
    "   - Include both outcode and full postal code\n",
    "   - Keep property characteristics as baseline features\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Improvements**\n",
    "   - Consider feature engineering for more location interactions\n",
    "   - Investigate non-linear relationships, especially in property features\n",
    "   - Possible benefit from ensemble methods\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Collection**\n",
    "   - Focus on gathering more detailed location data\n",
    "  - Get a better dataset, we've lost the rooms data of this dataset is poor quality!\n",
    "   - Consider additional property features\n",
    "   - Potential value in temporal data (sale dates, market conditions)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Practical Application**\n",
    "   - At present this model is probably not suitable for initial pricing estimates.\n",
    "   - We may be able to seperate the model in two, for smaller and larger properties, giving us a more accurate model for the smaller properties.\n",
    "   - Error margins should be communicated (±£566K on average)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Error Magnitude**\n",
    "   - Even best model has significant average error (£566K)\n",
    "   - RMSE indicates some very large prediction errors\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Complexity**\n",
    "   - Large number of features (662) may lead to overfitting\n",
    "   - Sparse matrix from location encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Location Dependency**\n",
    "   - Heavy reliance on location features\n",
    "   - May perform poorly in areas with limited data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider implementing:\n",
    "   - Feature reduction techniques (PCA)\n",
    "   - Ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost)\n",
    "   - Cross-validation for more robust evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explore:\n",
    "   - Feature interaction effects\n",
    "   - Non-linear transformations of numeric features\n",
    "   - More sophisticated location encoding methods\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Investigate:\n",
    "   - Temporal aspects of pricing\n",
    "   - Market condition indicators\n",
    "   - Regional price trends\n",
    "\n",
    "This updated analysis shows significant improvement over previous results, particularly in the R² score, but still indicates room for improvement in prediction accuracy."

    "## Comparing model types: Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to create a more robust and accurate model. Each tree in the forest is trained on a random subset of the data and features, and the final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach helps reduce overfitting and improves generalisation compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's called an ensemble method because random forests exemplify the \"wisdom of crowds\" principle - where combining many simpler models (the trees) leads to better performance than any individual model alone. This makes them particularly effective for complex regression and classification tasks."

    "### Comparing models: XGBoost gradient boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is another powerful ensemble learning method that builds on the principles of gradient boosting. It sequentially creates decision trees where each new tree tries to correct the errors made by the previous trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes XGBoost particularly effective is its use of regularisation techniques to prevent overfitting, along with optimisations that make it computationally efficient. It has become one of the most popular algorithms for structured/tabular data due to its strong predictive performance and ability to handle complex relationships in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like random forests, XGBoost combines multiple trees, but does so in a more focused way by giving more weight to previously misclassified examples. This often results in better performance than random forests, especially for complex regression tasks like house price prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally lets have a look at how we could implement XGBoost gradient boosting to our original and our onehot encoded dataset for feature subset: property + postcode + location + outcode."

    "\n",
    "While powerful, decision trees have some limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overfitting**: Deep trees can learn rules that are too specific to the training data.\n",
    "2. **Instability**: Small changes in the data can result in very different trees. \n",
    "3. **Bias towards features with many levels**: Trees prefer to split on features with many distinct values.\n",
    "4. **Difficulty capturing some relationships**: Trees struggle to model linear or smooth relationships.\n",
    "5. **High variance**: Predictions can vary significantly based on the specific training data used.\n",

    "\n",
    "When using machine learning for real-world applications like house price prediction, it's important to consider the potential ethical implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bias**: If the training data contains historical biases, the model may perpetuate these biases in its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transparency**: If the model is used to make important decisions (like mortgage approvals), there may be a legal or moral obligation to explain how it makes predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Privacy**: The model uses detailed personal information, so it's crucial to ensure that data is collected, stored, and used responsibly.\n",
