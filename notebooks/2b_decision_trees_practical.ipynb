        "Key implication: We need logarithmic price transformation because price impacts are multiplicative, not additive. A 10% improvement adds Â£80,000 to an Â£800,000 flat but Â£175,000 to a Â£1.75M house.\n",

        "When encoding location data for house price prediction, we face a fundamental challenge: locations with more data should have more influence on predictions, but we still want to extract signal from areas with sparse data. This is where hierarchical target encoding shines.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Tree Structure**\n",
        "   - Extremely deep tree of 62 levels\n",
        "   - A huge number of leaf nodes - at 2664 leaves its more of a bush than a tree!\n",
        "   - One average 1 sample per leaf\n",
        "   - Early splits focus on area and location\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Importance**\n",
        "   - Area dominates (75.1% importance)\n",
        "   - Location features contribute smaller amounts\n",
        "   - Bedrooms have surprisingly low impact (2.5%)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Price Predictions**\n",
        "   - Perfect on training data (RÂ² = 1.0)\n",
        "   - Large errors on test data (Â£670K average)\n",
        "   - Almost no training error (Â£1,233 MAE)\n",

        "### The Problem: Unrestricted Growth\n",

        "\n",

        "1. Splits on area into broad price bands\n",

        "Imagine you're trying to value a house in London. You could ask one expert, or you could ask a hundred experts and average their opinions. Or - and here's where it gets interesting - you could have experts learn from each other's mistakes. This is essentially the difference between our models.\n",

        "### How Our Models Think\n",
        "\n",
        "The Random Forest looks at our uncertainty directly. In the uncertainty vs error plot, we see something fascinating - as the trees disagree more (higher standard deviation), our prediction errors tend to increase. It's like when estate agents strongly disagree about a property's value, they're often dealing with an unusual property that's harder to price.\n",
        "\n",
        "XGBoost, on the other hand, learns sequentially. Looking at its training curve, we see rapid improvement in the first 20 rounds (that steep initial drop in error), followed by slower refinement. It's like an agent who quickly learns the basics of the market, then spends time mastering the nuances.\n",

        "**Random Forest:**\n",
        "- Area dominates (~40% importance)\n",
        "- Number of bedrooms second (~18%)\n",
        "- Property types and locations share the rest\n",

        "**XGBoost:**\n",

        "- More balanced importance across features\n",
        "\n",
        "This difference is fundamental - Random Forest builds many independent trees and averages them, while XGBoost carefully constructs each tree to fix previous mistakes.\n",

        "\n",
        "Think of it this way: Random Forest is like having 100 independent experts, while XGBoost is like having experts who learn from each other.

        "   - Could help identify properties needing human review\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Learning Process**\n",
        "   - XGBoost's sequential learning might capture market subtleties better\n",
        "   - The training curve suggests it's still learning at 100 rounds\n",

        "## Testing for Fairness in House Price Prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "While we're working with a limited Kaggle dataset, our fairness testing reveals important patterns that illuminate both the potential and challenges of automated valuation systems. The insights we've gained, even from this simplified view of London's housing market, provide valuable lessons about building more equitable systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Building a Meaningful Test\n",
        "\n",
        "We started with a straightforward but informative test framework. Our approach divides properties into three natural market segments: entry level (under Â£500K), mid-market (Â£500K to Â£1M), and premium properties (above Â£1M). For each segment, we measure absolute error, relative error, systematic bias, and how our predictions cluster geographically.\n",
        "\n",
        "The moment we created these segments, we ran into our first crucial challenge: these boundaries are fundamentally artificial. A property valued at Â£495K shares far more characteristics with one at Â£505K than one at Â£300K, yet our segmentation treats them differently. This tension between our need to categorise and the continuous nature of property values echoes throughout our analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What the Numbers Tell Us\n",
        "\n",
        "Our test revealed systematic patterns that we can't ignore:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "Entry:    22.9% error, +Â£61K bias    # Consistently overvalued\n",
        "Mid:      19.2% error, +Â£63K bias    # Most reliable predictions\n",
        "Premium:  21.6% error, -Â£300K bias   # Significant undervaluation\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "These aren't just statistics - they tell a story about how our model treats different parts of the market. That Â£61K overvaluation in the entry market could mean telling a first-time buyer they can't afford a house that should be within their reach. The strong mid-market performance likely reflects our training data's sweet spot, where properties are more standardised and transactions more frequent. The premium market's substantial undervaluation suggests our model struggles with the unique features and micro-location factors that drive high-end property values.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Potential Solutions and Their Challenges\n",
        "\n",
        "Our analysis suggests several promising approaches, each with its own advantages and significant challenges to consider.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first and most obvious solution is market segmentation - building separate models for different price bands. This approach lets us optimise for segment-specific features and handle different value scales more appropriately. A model focused purely on entry-level properties could learn the nuances of first-time buyer locations and property types. However, this immediately raises complex boundary problems:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def get_valuation(property_details):\n",
        "    # Calculate baseline value\n",
        "    baseline = estimate_rough_value(property_details)\n",
        "    \n",
        "    # Blend predictions near boundaries\n",
        "    if near_boundary(baseline):\n",
        "        models = get_relevant_models(baseline)\n",
        "        return weighted_blend(models, property_details)\n",
        "    \n",
        "    return get_primary_model(baseline).predict(property_details)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This code looks straightforward, but hides significant complexity. How do we handle a property valued at Â£495K this month that might be worth Â£505K next month? Should it suddenly be evaluated by a completely different model? We could implement smooth blending between models near boundaries, but this adds another layer of complexity to our system.\n",
        "\n",
        "A second approach focuses on confidence-based routing. Instead of segmenting by price, we route predictions based on how confident our model is:\n",
        "\n",
        "- High confidence â Automated valuation\n",
        "- Medium confidence â Quick human review\n",
        "- Low confidence â Full manual valuation\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This creates a natural scaling mechanism and focuses human expertise where it's most needed. But it raises its own challenges: How do we define confidence meaningfully? What metrics should we use? Setting these thresholds too high wastes human resources; too low risks automated mistakes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our third option involves enhanced feature engineering - tailoring our features to different market segments. Location might matter differently for a Â£300K flat versus a Â£3M house. School quality might be crucial in family-home price ranges but less relevant for luxury properties. This approach offers better predictive power through more focused features, but maintenance becomes complex. Features that matter in one price range might be irrelevant or even misleading in another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider how the importance of outdoor space varies:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def calculate_garden_value(property_details, price_band):\n",
        "    if price_band == 'premium':\n",
        "        return detailed_garden_analysis(property_details)\n",
        "    elif price_band == 'mid':\n",

        "    else:\n",
        "        return has_any_outdoor_space(property_details)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This kind of feature engineering must balance granularity against maintainability. More sophisticated features might improve predictions but make the system harder to update and monitor.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Practical Steps Forward\n",
        "\n",
        "Given these challenges, any deployed system needs to strike a careful balance. The model should serve as a support tool rather than a decision maker, with clear communication of uncertainty and thoughtful integration with human expertise. We need explicit fairness metrics, regular monitoring, and clear paths for handling edge cases and appeals.\n",
        "\n",
        "The potential for feedback loops presents a particular concern. If our model's predictions influence market prices, which then influence future predictions, we could inadvertently amplify biases over time. Regular analysis of segment-specific performance becomes crucial, as does active engagement with estate agents who understand local market dynamics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Learning from Limited Data\n",
        "\n",
        "The limitations of our Kaggle dataset shouldn't stop us from taking these insights seriously. They point toward crucial considerations for production systems:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Model roles need clear definition - supporting, not replacing, human judgment\n",
        "- System design must include fairness metrics and monitoring from day one\n",
        "- Edge cases and appeals require clear handling procedures\n",
        "- Stakeholder engagement becomes a crucial part of system maintenance\n",
        "\n",
        "### Moving Forward\n",
        "\n",
        "As we move to examine technical limitations, these fairness considerations provide essential context. A model's technical capabilities must be balanced against its potential market impact. The challenge isn't just building accurate models - it's building systems that serve all market participants fairly while acknowledging their own limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Behind every prediction is a person making one of the most important financial decisions of their life. Our models need to help make that decision fairer and more informed, not add new barriers to an already challenging process. Understanding these fairness implications isn't just an ethical requirement - it's a crucial part of building systems that work effectively in the real world."
